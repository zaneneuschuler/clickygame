## Clicky Game
A game where you can click pictures and then maybe win or something. Top possible score is 12, since there are only 12 pictures. If you click on a picture more than once, ya lose.

# How to play?
1. Click picture
2. Click different picture, hope picture is different
3. Get high score
4. Lose eventually

# How to build
1. Download source
2. `npm install` or `yarn` it up.
3. Change the pictures in the `cards.json` by changing the picture urls (beware, I normalized every picture to 150px because too lazy to style)
4. Build it however you want, it's a react app. There should be a guide in the create-react-app readme.
5. You now have a site, where you can click things.
